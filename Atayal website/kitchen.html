        <span id="hide">【Zhu Zhu】<br>Zhu Zhu is a traditional cooking method used by Atayal people, <br>where rice is cooked inside bamboo tubes. <br>After the rice has been soaked in water for eight hours, <br>it is stuffed inside the tubes, <br>which are then sealed with ginger leaves.<br> After the bamboo tubes have been steamed or boiled, <br>the rice is very fragrant and <br>has the scent of the ginger leaves.</span>

        <span id="hide4">【Tmmyan】<br>In traditional Atayal life, <br>no electricity meant no refrigerators could be used <br>to preserve foods which would typically spoil. <br>Atayal people instead used salt to preserve meat <br>and fish in a method called Tmmyan. <br>The meat would be cut into small chunks <br>and covered in salt before a layer was placed in a jar, <br>with a layer of half-boiled rice added on top.<br>These layers were repeated until the jar was full,<br>and sealed for at least one month.<br>Once opened the meat would remain safe to eat for half a year.</span>
