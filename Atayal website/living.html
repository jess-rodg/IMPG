      <span id="liv">【Bed】<br>Zhu Zhu is a traditional cooking method used by Atayal people, <br>where rice is cooked inside bamboo tubes. <br>After the rice has been soaked in water for eight hours, <br>it is stuffed inside the tubes, <br>which are then sealed with ginger leaves.<br> After the bamboo tubes have been steamed or boiled, <br>the rice is very fragrant and <br>has the scent of the ginger leaves.</span>
      <span id="liv2">【Male Mushroom- shaped Shell Earrings】<br>This set of man's earrings is characterised by its mushroom-shaped shell, and the four tassel pendants. The tassels are made of flaxen strings with beads and shells attached: Blue and red glass beads are at the top, a square shell is next, and then a string of alternating white shell beads and black beads follows. Finally, a copper bell is fastened at the end of each bead string. </span>
      <span id="liv3">【Curtain】<br>In traditional Atayal life, <br>no electricity meant no refrigerators could be used <br>to preserve foods which would typically spoil. <br>Atayal people instead used salt to preserve meat <br>and fish in a method called Tmmyan. <br>The meat would be cut into small chunks <br>and covered in salt before a layer was placed in a jar, <br>with a layer of half-boiled rice added on top.<br>These layers were repeated until the jar was full,<br>and sealed for at least one month.<br>Once opened the meat would remain safe to eat for half a year.</span>

      <span id="liv8">【“Basket”】<br>This basket measures 34 centimeters in length, 29 centimeters in width and 58 centimeters in height. It was used by women for gathering and carrying food or other items. Women’s baskets usually only had one strap for carrying on the forehead, while men’s baskets usually had two straps for carrying on the shoulders. Thus, the baskets used by the different genders could be distinguished by their straps.</span>
